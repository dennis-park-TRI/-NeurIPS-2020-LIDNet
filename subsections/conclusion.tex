In this work, we address two questions: \emph{how to propagate labels}, and \emph{how to train with noisy pseudo-labels}. Our propagation method utilizes the concept of cycle consistency of labels to significantly improve label propagation. Further, our noisy label learning approach effectively utilizes uncertainty to alleviate the drawbacks of training with noisy labels. Using the proposed ingredients, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes. The noisy label learning approach opens the door to utilizing more noisy augmentation processes such as image-based rendering methods~\cite{}, and in the future, we hope to extend our work in that direction.
